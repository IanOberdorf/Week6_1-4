At the time I produced this document the lab environment would not let me use git clone through the terminal.

You will need to open the vnc viewer, open the web browser in the server.
Go to https://github.com/IanOberdorf/Week6_1-4 and choose to download the zip.
Next you will need to extract the file to the desktop of the Student.
Go to the terminal environment and switch to root (su -)
As root go to the file on the student desktop (cd /home/Studen/Desktop/Week6_1-4)
add execute to the script (chmod +x Cheat.sh)
now execute the script (./Cheat.sh)
